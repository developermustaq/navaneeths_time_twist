# **App Name**: Navaneeth's Temporal Twist

## Core Features:

- App Heading: Display a heading 'Navaneeth's Timer' with the subheading 'Here Time Runs Differently'.
- Task Creation: Allow users to input tasks and set the adjusted 'hour-scale' timer for each task.
- Adjusted Timer Display: Display the countdown timer, adjusted by the new scale of time, for each active task.
- Task Completion Options: Provide 'Mark as Completed' and 'Not Completed' buttons upon timer completion. Tasks will be automatically moved into dead tasks after 30 min if no option selected
- Archived Tasks: Display an area to store a task once a time expires without user interaction for too long

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to suggest mystery and the unknown, related to the altered perception of time.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) to provide a minimalistic background that keeps focus on the timer and tasks.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to complement the indigo without drawing too much attention, keeping with the subtle aesthetic.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Subtle animations for timer transitions and task completion.
- A clean, single-column layout focusing on task list and timer.
